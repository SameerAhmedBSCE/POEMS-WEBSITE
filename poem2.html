      Old MacDonald had a farm<br>
Ee i ee i o<br>
And on his farm he had some cows<br>
Ee i ee i oh<br>
With a moo-moo here<br>
And a moo-moo there<br>
Here a moo, there a moo<br>
Everywhere a moo-moo<br>
Old MacDonald had a farm<br>

Here a cluck, there a cluck<br>
Everywhere a cluck-cluck<br>
Old MacDonald had a farm<br>
