           Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
                How I wonder what you are!<br>
                Up above the world so high,<br>
              Like a diamond in the sky.<br>

              When the blazing sun is gone,<br>
              When the nothing shines upon,<br>
              Then you show your little light,<br>
              Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br>

             Then the trav'ller in the dark,<br>
             Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br>
               He could not see which way to go,<br>
                If you did not twinkle so.<br>

             In the dark blue sky you keep,<br>
           And often thro' my curtains peep,<br>
                For you never shut your eye,<br>
           Till the sun is in the sky.  </p>
